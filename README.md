# Child-Abuse-Graph-in-Japan
For one of the classes I took when I was in Year 3, I decided to write a program to generate a bar graph, which shows the number of reported child abuse cases in Japan from 2008 to 2017. 

I obtained my data from https://www.mhlw.go.jp/content/11901000/000348313.pdf.

Please make sure to put the processing and csv files in the same directory.
