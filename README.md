# Child-Abuse-Graph-in-Japan
This is a program that generates a series of bar graphs, which shows the number of reported child abuse cases in Japan from 2008 to 2017. I obtained the stats from https://www.mhlw.go.jp/content/11901000/000348313.pdf.

The mp4 file shows how my program works. 

**Important Notes**

Please make sure to put the processing and csv files in the same folder, which should be named "FinalProject".
